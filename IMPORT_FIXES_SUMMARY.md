# Import Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Import Path Issues
- **Fixed in cell 16**: Changed `from Classification.sider_baseline_models.py import` to `from Classification.src.sider_baseline_models import`
- **Fixed in cell 3**: Changed data path from `/content/Chemoinformatics_project/data/raw/sider.csv` to `../data/raw/sider.csv`

### 2. RDKit PandasTools Compatibility
- **Fixed in `Classification/src/sider_preprocessing.py`**:
  - Removed problematic `PandasTools` import that had compatibility issues with newer pandas versions
  - Replaced `PandasTools.AddMoleculeColumnToFrame()` with a direct approach using `df['Molecule'] = df['canonical_smiles'].apply(lambda x: Chem.MolFromSmiles(x))`

### 3. Missing Dependencies Installed
The following packages were installed to fix import errors:
- `torch_geometric` - for Graph Neural Network support
- `pytorch_lightning` - for deep learning training framework
- `transformers` - for ChemBERTa transformer models
- `torchmetrics` - required by pytorch_lightning
- `optuna` - for Bayesian optimization
- `ogb` - Open Graph Benchmark library
- `wandb` - for experiment tracking
- `pycm` - for confusion matrix analysis

### 4. Known Issues
- **DeepChem**: Not installed due to Python 3.12 compatibility issues. The notebook mentions this in comments and provides alternative implementations using `Classification/src/sider_featurizer.py`

## Current Status
✅ All required imports are now working correctly (except DeepChem which is not needed)
✅ The notebook should run without import errors
✅ All custom modules from `Classification/src/` are importable
✅ All machine learning libraries are properly installed

## To Run the Notebook
1. Make sure you're in the project root directory: `/Users/elisa/CHEMO/Chemoinformatics_project`
2. Run Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
3. Open `Classification/SIDER_analysis.ipynb`
4. The imports should now work correctly

## Test Script
A test script has been created at `test_imports.py` to verify all imports are working. Run it with:
```bash
python test_imports.py
```
